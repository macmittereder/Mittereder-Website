			h3 This app was a contractor project through Blast Off Apps developed for
				| iOS using Xcode. Fast Movie Photos is a website online that the client makes photo movies for their clients and posts them
				| on the website. The purpose of the app is for the client to be able to access the videos online and adjust the playback speed
				| as the video is playing. The videos were accessed using a link directly to them with the media api provided by Apple.
