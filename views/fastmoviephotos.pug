		empty This app was a contractor project through Blast Off Apps developed for
		iOS using Xcode. Fast Movie Photos is a website online that the client makes photo movies for their clients and posts them
		on the website. The purpose of the app is for the client to be able to access the videos online and adjust the playback speed
		as the video is playing. The videos were accessed using a link directly to them with the media api provided by Apple.
