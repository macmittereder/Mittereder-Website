			h3 This app was developed for my capstone project for Saint Vincent College using Android Studio and Firebase. Gradez allows users to track their grades 
				| for classes that are accumulative or weighted. Firebase is used to manage users and for a database. Below is a representation of my capstone

					.col-md-12.col-xs-12
						p.black Students often have trouble keeping track of grades and some teachers don’t use the tools provided to post grades online
							| for the students to view. Gradez is a mobile application developed for the Android platform to solve this dilemma. This 
							| application calculates class grades that are either accumulative points or in weighted categories. All data and user accounts
							| are stored in a cloud database called Firebase allowing users to be logged into as many devices as they want with uniform data
							| across them. When grades are added to the user’s account the data will refresh on any other devices so that the data can be kept
							| synchronous. This Android application is available for free on the Google Play store and gives students an easy solution to keep
							| track of their grades.

						li Previous experience: Never used a database with an Android application.
						li Current experience: Developed multiple Android applications as a contractor.
						li Gained experience by creating Android applications in my free time over the years and through being a contractor.
						li This Android application specializes in calculating students grades for classes that are accumulative or weighted where other apps focus on only one type of grading scale. 
						li Firebase, a cloud-based databased,  is used so users will never lose their information and can login from any Android device to view their grades.

						p.black Firebase includes the ability to program a set rules list to dictate how users interact with the database. The rules above use the
							| same logic for users reading information from the database and writing information to the database. For users to interact with the
							| database their unique identifier must match the unique identifier of the information the user is trying to read from or write to.

							p.black This structure type is known as a NoSQL database. The different fields have no relation to each other, other than the fields
							| having a parent/child relationship. This kind of database utilizes real time updates, and is cloud-hosted, so data redundancy is
							| retained. Real time updates assist this app when users have multiple devices concurrently running it. When any data is added, edited,
							| or deleted on one device, the other devices will refresh showing the changes as to keep all devices synced. Redundancy of data is vital
							| in today’s society when users could lose, damage, or replace their device. When any of these circumstances occur the user will retain
							| their data.

						p.black The process of learning, planning, and development of this Android project has made it work in its entirety. Firebase will keep
						| supporting this application while being used without any changes to it. Gradez is also available on the Google Play store where anyone
						| across the Earth can download it and use it.
