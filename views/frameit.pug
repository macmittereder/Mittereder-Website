			h3 Created senior year of high school for iOS developed in xCode. The idea of this app was brought
				| to me by a classmate and we became partners to develop it. I was responsible for
				| the programming part of the project and he did the visual aspect of it using vector art.
				| Before release of the app we strategically advertised it with social media to build up the popularity.
				| After the release of FrameIt the app was placed on the top paid photography app list and
				| made it on the list of overall top paid apps.
