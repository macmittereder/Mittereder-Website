			h3 Created senior year of high school for Android using Eclipse. I developed this app to make it easier to view the Franklin
				|  Regional school district website and bypass their mobile version. Push notifications were also implemented using the Parse api
				| to alert users of delays and cancellations. This app uses a master detail view for a slide out menu and a webview to
				| display the different webpages.
