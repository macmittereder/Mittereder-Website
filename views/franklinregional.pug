		empty Created senior year of high school for Android using Eclipse. I developed this app to make it easier to view the Franklin
		Regional school district website and bypass thier mobile version. Push notifications were also implemented using hte Parse api
		to alert users of delays and cancellations. This app uses a master detail view for a slide out menu and a webview to
		display the different webpages.
